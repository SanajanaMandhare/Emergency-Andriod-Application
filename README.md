# Emergency-Andriod-Application
The App is mainly built for emergency management and its objective is to give first-hand information to the user about the emergency incident and reduce the potential damage which occurs during the disaster by informing others about the emergency situations. The main goal of this app is to send an alert message to the user in an event of an emergency such as a natural disaster, terrorist attack etc. Also, it will provide users with helpline information such as nearby hospital number, police station number, Fire Services Number, Blood Bank Number etc. and also navigation details to that location so as to help the user help himself rather than waiting for help to arrive and wasting precious time.
